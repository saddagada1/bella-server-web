Backend for an ecommerce marketplace inspired by Depop. 

Includes authentication, account and store setup, creating products and orders, shopping carts, checkout, payment, and shipping. 

It has not been deployed yet and has been put on hiatus as I am in the process of refactoring both the backend and frontend to a different stack.
